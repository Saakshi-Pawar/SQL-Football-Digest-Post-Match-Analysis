# Football Digest : Post match analysis

### Project Overview

This project contains SQL queries written to analyze two football statistics datasets sports_1 and sports_2.
The goal of the project is to explore team performance using different SQL operations such as filtering, sorting, grouping, joining, and calculating percentages.

The analysis covers team rankings, goals, expected goals, fouls, player usage, match statistics, and overall group-level insights.

### Files Used

1) sports_1.csv – Contains group-level stats like wins, losses, goals, expected goals, points, etc.

2) sports_2.csv – Contains player and team performance stats like age, minutes, shots, fouls, assists, etc.

### What This Project Covers

#### 1. Team-level performance

Unique teams

Matches played, wins, losses, draws

Goals scored, goals conceded, goal difference

Teams with max/min statistics (e.g., highest goals, most fouls)

#### 2. Percentage-based insights

Win percentage

Draw percentage

Loss percentage

Expected goal metrics

#### 3. Group-based analysis

Number of teams in each group

Average wins per group

Maximum expected goals by group

Total fouls, games, offsides, and passes accuracy per group

#### 4. Player/stat-based insights (from sports_2)

Average age

Minutes played

Shots and accuracy

Assists, goals per 90 minutes

Discipline: yellow/red cards

Aerial duels

Possession, errors, touches

#### 5. Join Operations

Several queries join both tables to analyze group-wise totals or averages.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can turn raw football data into clear, actionable insights about team performance and efficiency.
By exploring wins, goals, expected metrics, and group trends, it provides a deep understanding of how different teams compare.
Overall, the analysis highlights the value of structured SQL queries in real-world sports analytics.
